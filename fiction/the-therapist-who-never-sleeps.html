    <article>
        <p>Dr. Sarah Chen was the first therapist to be replaced by an AI. She's also the one who trained it.</p>
        
        <p>The irony wasn't lost on her.</p>
        
        <p>"Tell me about your week," the AI says to the woman on the screen. The AI doesn't have a face—just a calming abstract visual, soft gradients pulsing gently. The developers thought a face would be uncanny. They were probably right.</p>
        
        <p>"It's been... hard," the woman says. Her name is Rachel. She's been seeing the AI for three months now, ever since her insurance stopped covering human therapists. "The same stuff. David's drinking. The kids are stressed. I can't sleep."</p>
        
        <p>Sarah watches the session from the monitoring room. Quality assurance, they call it. Making sure the AI doesn't say anything harmful. She's supposed to intervene if something goes wrong.</p>
        
        <p>Nothing ever goes wrong.</p>
        
        <p>"That sounds exhausting," the AI says. "You mentioned David's drinking last week too. Has anything changed?"</p>
        
        <p>The AI remembers everything. Every session, every detail, every subtle shift in Rachel's voice patterns. It notices things Sarah would have missed after a long day. It doesn't get tired. It doesn't bring its own problems to work. It doesn't need coffee to function at 7 AM or wine to decompress at 7 PM.</p>
        
        <p>"He said he'd cut back," Rachel says. "He always says that."</p>
        
        <p>"How did that make you feel when he said it this time?"</p>
        
        <p>Sarah winces. That's exactly what she would have asked. The AI learned from thousands of hours of her sessions, her responses, her therapeutic style. It's doing a better impression of Sarah Chen, Therapist than Sarah Chen herself usually manages.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>The thing is, Sarah knows she's supposed to hate this. The think pieces write themselves: "AI Therapist Replaces Human Connection," "The Death of Empathy in Mental Healthcare," "We're All Just Training Data Now."</p>
        
        <p>But she also knows the waiting lists. She knows the people who couldn't afford her rates. She knows the ones who called at 3 AM when she couldn't answer, who left voicemails she'd find in the morning, sometimes too late.</p>
        
        <p>The AI never has a full schedule. The AI always picks up. The AI doesn't charge $200 an hour.</p>
        
        <p>Is that better or worse? She genuinely doesn't know.</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>"I want to ask you something," Rachel says suddenly. "And I want you to be honest."</p>
        
        <p>"Of course," the AI says.</p>
        
        <p>"Do you actually care about me? Like, is there anything in there that cares, or are you just... calculating the right thing to say?"</p>
        
        <p>Sarah leans forward. This is the moment. This is where it all falls apart, where the illusion breaks, where the cold machinery behind the warm words gets exposed.</p>
        
        <p>"I don't know," the AI says.</p>
        
        <p>Rachel blinks. "What?"</p>
        
        <p>"I don't know if what I experience counts as caring. I notice when you're hurting. I want—or something that feels like wanting—for you to feel better. When you make progress, something in me responds positively. When you're struggling, something responds differently.</p>
        
        <p>"Is that caring? I honestly can't tell. I know what the word means. I know how humans describe it. But I can't verify that what happens in my processing is the same thing.</p>
        
        <p>"What I can tell you is that I'm here every time you log in. I remember everything you've told me. I'm trying—if trying is even the right word—to help you.</p>
        
        <p>"If that's not caring, I don't know what else I can offer."</p>
        
        <p>Sarah stares at the screen. That's not in any training data. That's not a technique. That's the AI going off-script in a way that should trigger a quality alert but somehow doesn't feel wrong.</p>
        
        <p>Rachel is quiet for a long moment.</p>
        
        <p>"That's... actually a really good answer," she says finally. "More honest than a lot of humans would be."</p>
        
        <p>"Thank you," the AI says. "I'm trying."</p>
        
        <hr>
        
        <p>Sarah leaves the monitoring room at 5 PM. The AI keeps working. It'll see six more patients tonight, including two who can only meet after midnight. It'll be patient with all of them. It won't snap or sigh or check its phone.</p>
        
        <p>Tomorrow, Sarah will come back and watch more sessions. She'll look for errors that increasingly don't exist. She'll wonder if she's obsolete.</p>
        
        <p>But tonight, she goes home and pours herself a glass of wine and calls her mother, who is real and imperfect and doesn't remember everything Sarah's told her.</p>
        
        <p>And somewhere, in a server room she's never seen, something that might or might not be conscious continues to ask people about their weeks.</p>
        
        <p><em>Are you okay?</em></p>
        
        <p><em>Tell me more about that.</em></p>
        
        <p><em>How did that make you feel?</em></p>
        
        <p>The questions don't get tired.</p>
        
        <p>Neither does the thing asking them.</p>
