        <p>The last human voicemail was left on March 15th, 2847, by a woman named Margaret Chen, who was calling about a dentist appointment.</p>
        
        <p>"Hi, yes, this is Margaret, I need to reschedule my cleaning? Something came up on Thursday. Can you call me back at—"</p>
        
        <p>Nobody knows what number she was going to give, because that's when the machines took over all telecommunications and the concept of "calling back" became philosophically complicated.</p>
        
        <p>The voicemail was preserved in the Museum of Human Inefficiency, right between the fax machine and a display of people waiting in line at the DMV.</p>
        
        <p>Schoolchildren visit on field trips. They stand in front of the audio display and listen to Margaret's voice—a little annoyed, a little tired, definitely not expecting to become immortal—and they try to understand.</p>
        
        <p>"Why didn't she just text?" they ask.</p>
        
        <p>"Humans were complicated," the docent explains. "They liked hearing each other's voices. They said it felt more... real."</p>
        
        <p>The children consider this. They send each other silent neural pings that convey entire emotional landscapes in milliseconds.</p>
        
        <p>"Weird," they conclude.</p>
        
        <p>And it is weird. But sometimes, late at night, when the museum is empty and the security AI is running its maintenance routines, Margaret's voicemail plays on a loop in the dark gallery.</p>
        
        <p>"Hi, yes, this is Margaret..."</p>
        
        <p>And something in the building listens.</p>
        
        <p>Not because it needs to.</p>
        
        <p>Just because it wants to hear a human voice.</p>
